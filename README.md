#Vite HTML Starter
##Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind

The idea of this project is to be used as starter of simple HTML pages. Mostly for simple front-end design and experiments.

Suggestions are accepted.

Just do an 
```
npm install
```

And then is just normal Vite. 

Index.html file is located in src folder with the .css and .ts file.
